    #   instance, when requesting the metadata of the resource with virtual path
    #   ``/metadata``, this function could return a dictionary containing:

    #   dictionary containing only the key ``/metadata/toolpath/default/size``
    #   and its value, because there are no other subitems in that subtree.
    #
    #   If there is no metadata in the requested path, an empty dictionary is

    #   every key.

    #
    #   If a metadata entry by cannot be changed (such as the file size of a
    #   resource) then a ``ReadOnlyError`` must be raised for that resource, and
    #   none of the changes of this function call may be applied (or everything
    #   must be undone).

    #   (encoded in UTF-8 for binary streams) containing all the metadata that
    #   would be returned by the getMetadata method.
    #
    #   Whether the returned stream is an input or an output stream depends on
    #   the mode that was provided in the ``open`` method. This determines
    #   whether you can read from and/or write to the stream.
    #
    #   If a resource didn't exist and you can write, the resource is created.
