# Cura Packages
You can read and write a `.curapackage` file with ease using libCharon.

## Reading
You can create a new CuraPackage instance form an existing `.curapackage` file so it's easy to parse the contents.

```python
package = CuraPackage()
package.openStream(open("TestPackage.curapackage", "rb"))
```

After this, you can call the convinience methods on the package instance.

### Getting materials
You can get a list of available materials in the package using the `getMaterials` method.

```python
material_files = package.getMaterials()
```

This returns a list of full file paths relative to the package root.
You can then get the contents of any of the materials using the `getStream` method.

```python
for material_file_path in material_files:
    material_data = package.getStream(material_file_path)
```

This returns a `BytesIO` object to read the data from in the needed format.

## Writing
First, create a new package instance that we can write data to.

```python
stream = io.BytesIO()
package = CuraPackage()
package.openStream(stream, mode=OpenMode.WriteOnly)
```

After adding your data (see details below), don't forget to close the package.

```python
package.close()
```

### Adding materials
To add a material, you can use the `addMaterial` convinience method.
This will take care of the relationships, path alias and other implementation details of OPC.

```python
material_data = open("my_material.xml.fdm_material", "rb").read()
package.addMaterial(material_data=material_data, package_filename="my_material.xml.fdm_material")
```

### package.json
Each `.curapackage` has a `package.json` file with some metadata about the package.
LibCharon makes adding this metadata easy as well.

```python
package.setMetadata({"/package_id": "CharonTestPackage"})
```

This example added an entry to the JSON object as `{"package_id": "CharonTestPackage"}`.

### Adding a plugin
A CuraPackage can contain one or more Cura plugins. These are stored under the `/files/plugins` directory in the package.
A convenience method `addPlugin` is available in the library to sort this all out for you.

```python
plugin_root_path = os.path.abspath("MyCuraPlugin.zip")
package.addPlugin(open(plugin_root_path, "rb").read(), plugin_id="MyCuraPlugin")
```

This code example will take a ZIP called `MyCuraPlugin/zip` that lives in your current working directory and adds it to the package as plugin.
During this process, the ZIP file will be extracted, scanned for validity and the files are placed in the correct paths.
The library will also validate the contents of the ZIP file, for example if the required `plugin.json` and `__init__.py` files are available.
